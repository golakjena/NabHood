				<h2>NABHOOD</h2>
				<h5>National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators &amp; Developers, Inc.</h5>
				<h3>NABHOOD MISSION STATEMENT &amp; HISTORY</h3>
				<p><strong>Mission Statement: Increase the number of African-Americans developing, managing, operating and owning hotels; increase vendor opportunities &amp; executive level jobs for minorities, thereby creating wealth within the African-American community.</strong></p>
				<p>In 1998 Andy Ingraham, founder of The Multicultural Tourism Summit &amp; president of Horizons Marketing Group, along with Solomon Herbert, Publisher of Black Meetings &amp; Tourism Magazine, brought together a small a group of African American tourism professionals assembled at the Multicultural Tourism Summit &amp; Trade Show at the Fort Lauderdale Marina Marriott in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with the idea of forming an association to help develop and increase the number of African American owned hotels.  The group further decided that the industry did not have a good record for including African Americans and other minorities in many of the top executive positions nor was there a lot of business being done with minority vendors.  It was agreed that the association would work toward educating the industry on how they can improve the current situation and at the same time, use the resources of the association to help the industry.  At that time, there were no major franchised African American hotels of any consequence in the U.S.</p>
				<p>In the early seventies, eighties and nineties there were only three hotels in the United States that were franchised and part of a major hotel chain. The first was a Holiday Inn in Tuskegee, AL that opened in the early seventies and later became the Tuskegee Inn before going out of business. The second was opened by Mabra Holeyfield and Frank Banks as the Benchmark Hotel in 1983 and became the Days Inn in 1988.  That hotel was sold in 2008 to NABHOOD’s Chairman, Mike Roberts and will be converted to a Clarion Collection.  The third was the 105 room Travelodge Hotel when an investment group led by the city’s first African American mayor and businessman Harvey Gantt, purchased a bankrupt hotel and cafeteria in the heart of Charlotte’s African American community. After a two million dollar renovation, the hotel opened in July 1998.  There were a few flagstones with small hotels like the first Black owned hotel in the nation’s capital, Howard Inn, that opened as the Humbree House in the early eighties and the 120 room Paschal’s Motor Hotel in Atlanta, GA that opened in 1967.</p>
				<p>The new group used as a rational that African Americans were the largest group of minority travelers in the industry and spending twenty-five billion dollars annually at that time.  After much discussion, the association was incorporated in 2001.  NABHOOD held its first board meeting at former Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts defensive end Donnell Thompson’s Sleep Inn, located in Peachtree City outside of Atlanta, Georgia.  Donnell Thompson was elected as the first Chairman and Andy Ingraham became the President.  Attending that first meeting was the new Chairman &amp; President, along with Carroll Warfield of Thayer lodging, Don Rose of Accor, Jay Patel of Lodging Hospitality Systems and James Kimble of Boersma Travel. Andy had already begun working with the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA) and one of the first things NABHOOD did was to form a strategic alliance with them. A seat on the board was created so that the current AAHOA chairman can serve as an ex officio board member.  The organization seeks to become a major force in the industry.</p>
